        <h3 id="journalSubTitle">Environment</h3> <p id="journalText"> 
            This is a continuation on the thoughts I found reading an article by Another Mountains Rock & you can check out 
            the article from Seeking Alpha <a class="jLinks" href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4433526-csgo-skin-market-reflections-on-crypto-speculation-search-for-high-yield">here.</a>
            This article was one of many inspirations that got me thinking. Wait, this whole NFT thing Valve basically started. Not only that,
            but they could be raking in alot more cash & providing alot more value to customers if they cared at all about the implications of 
            web3.
        </p>
        <h3 id="journalSubTitle">Thesis</h3>
        <p id="journalText">Valve could easily control & dominate the online PC gaming NFT market (But they won‚Äôt). 
            NFT‚Äôs have been in the headlines for many different reasons. We won‚Äôt touch on that today. Today we will 
            be speaking about what an NFT Game MarketPlace would look like if it were run by Valve. 
        </p>
        <h4 id="journalChapter">
            Cosmetics 
        </h4>
        <p id="journalText">
            An example of an in game economy/marketplace would be the one found in the game counterstrike global offensive. 
            In counterstrike a player can purchase an in game item from a market of other players selling that item. Items are 
            acquired through ‚ÄúLoot Crates‚Äù which act as a sort of a game of roulette. Basically a player through the process of playing 
            the game is gifted crates at random. In these crates contain skins differing in rarity. 
        </p>
        <div>
        <img class="textImg" src="https://c.tenor.com/YEZ_lL8izyUAAAAd/pain-csgo.gif">
        <p class="textImgT">Example of what it's like opening a skin crate</p>
        </div>
        <p id="journalText">
            This is one method of receiving skins. 
            If you don‚Äôt want to receive the skin at random & know which skin you do want does Valve offer the skins 
            for direct purchase? Well, yes & no. Lets say you really wanted a certain skin & don‚Äôt want to endlessly
             unlock crates to receive the skin you want. You would think you could go right up to Valve & just buy the skin
              but they have a different solution. Create a market. So if you want a skin, you can buy that skin off another
               player who already has that skin in their inventory. 
        </p>
        <div>
            <img class="textImg" src="https://media.steelseriescdn.com/blog/posts/why-are-csgo-skins-priced-so-differently/9fed5b3f04ab4eea9a3a88db4b94b1cc.png">
            <p class="textImgT"></p>
        </div>
        <p id="journalText">
            As you can see from pic above, prices fluctuate. If I wanted to purchase a skin I would have to buy 
            it from another player who has that skin.
        </p>
            <p id="journalText"> 
            Now what if you had a skin you wanted to sell? Well you can sell that skin too, & at whatever price you‚Äôd like. 
            As you see there is a ‚Äúmarket rate‚Äù for any particular skin, but that doesn‚Äôt mean you have to sell your skin at 
            that price. 
        </p>
        <p id="journalText">
        So markets for online digital goods have been a thing for awhile now. What makes NFT‚Äôs so different? 
        </p>

        <h4 id="journalChapter">Dividends</h4>

        <p id="journalText">
            Enjoying the fruits of your labor is one of the greatest feelings a human can experience.
             Doing honest good work, being recognized & rewarded for that work, is up there among having
              sex & petting a cat as the pinnacles of the human experience. 
        </p>

        <p id="journalText">
                What NFT‚Äôs do is create a space for artists to get paid for their works. Imagine 
                a 19 year old whose passion is creating art. They post their work online & they get 
                ‚Äúrewarded‚Äù with like points I call it. These like points come in the form of Reddit karma, 
                Instagram likes, Twitter favorites. People can copy & spread the image you created & its great. 
                Now imagine someone could pay you for that original post. That first time you posted that image,
                officially from you, someone could buy that. That is NFT‚Äôs. This may sound strange to some but I
                can assure you this is a great thing for the artist communities online. 
        </p>

        
        <h4 id="journalChapter">Back to skins.</h4>

        <p id="journalText">
            Whenever a new crate drops, its filled with new skins. Who makes these skins? 
            Sometimes Valve, most times independent creators. NFT'ing the skin market would mean. 
            That when someone releases a skin, they can earn income off that skin much like now, but
             also earn income every time that skin is traded. 
        </p>

        <p id="journalText">
            So lets say our artists from before made a csgo skin that made it into the game. 
            They would not only earn income for that original skin submission but also have the 
            potential to earn income off of every transaction that skin is involved in. Over the 
            next 30 years 3D modeling, Asset creation & Mixed Reality Architecting will be a huge
            industry (it already is). Giving artists the freedom & the opportunity to earn off of 
            their hardwork is a good thing. Sure there are a lot of scams now, but give this industry 
            some time to mature. 
        </p>
