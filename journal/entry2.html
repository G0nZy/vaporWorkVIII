          Elon musks purchase of Twitter & the rise of the ‚ÄúAmerican Super App‚Äù
        </p>
        <h3 id="journalSubTitle">Thesis</h3>
        <p id="journalText">Elon‚Äôs plan with Twitter is to create A ‚ÄúSuper App‚Äù 
          an app that will act as the only app you will ever need to use, from
           booking driverless taxis to sending money to friends. Continue reading

            What Is A Super App
        </h4>
        <p id="journalText">
          So lets begin with the concept of a Super App. A super app is an app usually on 
          ones smartphone that is basically every app in one. Many Eastern Nations have super 
          apps totally run & controlled by the government. From these apps one can book plane 
          flights, reserve a dinner table, pay for items or even send money to a friend, text & 
          call & much more. This is the reality with apps like WeChat which is the most popular app
           in China. With a userbase of 1.2 Billion they have a near monopoly on the Apps Market. Contrast 
           this to United States backed Tech Companies, Facebook, Paypal, Twitter, iMessage, Signal etc. For 
           the most part, most Americans use one or more of these apps to accomplish tasks like Sending & Receiving Messages
            (FB, Twitter, iMessage, Instagram, WhatsApp), or Making & Receiving Payments (Paypal, CashApp, Venmo) or even just
             to post to the world on your own page & talk about your day (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram). Imagine if all these 
             apps were in one. The same way you were to write a tweet you could order food, or send someone those 5 bucks you owe
              them. This is the reality super apps bring & Elon has yet another crazy idea brewing.

          Elon Bids to Acquire Twitter
      </h4>
        <p id="journalText">
          On the 25th of April it was announced that Elon musk had offered to buy Twitter & take the company Private at $54.20/share 
          making the buyout a 45 billion dollar deal. Seemed like no problem at the time for the man whose net worth was hovering around 
          the 250 billion mark. Since then, markets have taken a huge slump as 2022 seems like it will be the worst year for stocks in a 
          long time. As of writing this Elon has lost roughly 60 billion of his fortune due to market conditions.

          Why Would He Want To Own Twitter?
      </h4>
      <p id="journalText">
        There are many reasons a billionaire would want to own a social media platform. 
        Elon is a genius at cross marketing his brands without ever having to (famously) pay for
         any advertising. It is a magnificent feat that Tesla is the most valuable automotive brand 
         in the entire world & they have never had not one Super Bowl Ad. It‚Äôs truly remarkable & a 
         testament to the loyalty around the brand he‚Äôs cultivated and the product itself. So why Twitter? 
         Besides the free advertising for his Tesla car there is a deeper motivation for wanting to own a platform
          as popular and widely used as Twitter.

        <h4 id="journalChapter">Phase I</h4>
        <h4 id="journalChapter">Universal Verification</h4>
        <p id="journalText">
          The first part of his plan seems to be universal verification. 
          The infamous ‚Äúblue check mark for all‚Äù. The point of this I believe is to
           get everyone to give their real birth days, addresses & cell phone numbers. 
           Once a user is fully verified this will limit the amount of trolling done as 
           people who want their content to be seen will have to verify themselves and
